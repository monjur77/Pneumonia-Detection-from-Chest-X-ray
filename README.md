# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection by Chest X-ray Using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting Pneumonia using chest X-ray images and deep learning techniques. We trained a binary classification model that distinguishes between normal and pneumonia-infected lungs by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Python-based machine learning libraries.

## 📂 Dataset
We used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which contains a total of 5,856 chest X-ray images.

## Pneumonia cases: 4,624 images (≈ 79%)

## Normal cases: 1,232 images (≈ 21%)

This imbalance in class distribution was taken into account during model evaluation.
